# OmniAuth Demo

This is a tiny little app that takes an Oauth login from Google, then displays the user's data. 

## Set up
I'm assuming you have Ruby 2.4.2 and Rails 5.1.4 installed

1. Clone the project: `$ git clone https://github.com/jsheridanwells/OmniAuthDemo.git`
2. Open the project directions: `$ cd OmniAuthDemo`
3. Install the gems: `$ bundle install`
4. Run the server: `rails server`
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
6. Sign in with Google and on the next page you'll see items from your Google user hash.
